                <h3>Ready Set Summer</h3>
                <h4>Branding - Advertising - Illustration</h4>
                
             <p> A fun treasure map themed campaign aimed at school kids encouraging them to keep active during the summer holidays. Commissioned by a local charity, I was the lead designer on this project from name and concept development, to illustration and preparation of the final artwork. Fun packs were created and sent out to homes and schools, which included reading materials for parents and teachers. An interactive poster was created featuring a treasure map filled with activities together with matching stickers to mark off activities once finished. Who doesn't love stickers?
