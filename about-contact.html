            <p>Hi, I'm Rachele - a designer based in Vancouver.
                Graduated with an honours degree in  Visual Communications from <a href="http://www.lsadviscom.ie/">LSAD</a> Ireland. I then worked at the lovely <a href="https://whitenoisestudios.com/">Whitenoise Studios</a> for two years before relocating to Vancouver. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoy bringing clarity and clever ideas to projects helping to create memorable user experiences across print and digital. I work on branding and print, UI and UX, web design and a spot of front end development. 
                I also love to crochet and I follow way too many Instagram dog accounts.
            </p>
