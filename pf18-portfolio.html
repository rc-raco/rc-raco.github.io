         <h4>Kainos Software, Belfast</h4>
        <p>During my time as a designer with Whitenoise Studios, I worked on the rebrand for Kainos. My team and I worked from the concept stages of the rebrand and developed the brand guidelines and visual language for all the sub brands of the company. For each sub brand, we developed a suite of icons, an image style and powerpoint slide decks. We also created new visuals and directed the redesign for the company's website.</p>

        <p><br>I also worked on a lot of event branding projects for the company. Many events like career fairs and conferences all required individual brands or a unique visual style. I worked with marketing teams to develop styles and illustrations for such events that would be applied to everything from flyers and tshirts to banner stand and full stage sets and photo props. For some projects, I would work with the motion team and create animated gifs for use on the company's website or social media.  </p>
